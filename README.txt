TAY Forge Initiative - Static Website (Full)
-------------------------------------------

What's included:
- index.html       : Main single-page site with sections (Home, About, Focus Pillars, Programs, Get Involved, Donate, Contact)
- styles.css       : Styling
- script.js        : Contact form JS (opens mail client)
- assets/          : Basic SVG logo and icons (replace with your own images if desired)
- README.txt       : This file

How to use:
1. Unzip the package.
2. Open index.html in your browser to preview.
3. Replace placeholders: [Your Name], [Your Phone], PayPal link, and bank details with real info.
4. Host on static hosts (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel) or any web server.

Contact form behavior:
- The contact form opens the user's email client (mailto:) and does not submit data to a server.
- To store messages, integrate a form backend (Formspree, Getform) and update the form action in index.html.

Need help customizing? I can replace placeholders, add your images/logo, or wire a hosted form. Tell me what you'd like next.
